A desktop application built with Tauri for viewing and interacting with Spine skeletal animations and Live2D models.

**Key Features**:

- 📂 Drag-and-drop model loading (single folder or single compressed file: zip or 7z only)
- 📦 Direct loading/extracting from Unity asset files
- 🎭 Triple support for Spine, Live2D, and Layered Sprite (Unity files only) models
- 🔍 Automatic alpha mode detection from the atlas pages (chooses between PMA and UNPACK only; an explicit NPM setting is never overwritten)
